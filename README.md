## Programming Exercises

This repository contains the following programming exercises from the MLCC:

### 1. **Linear Regression**

In this exercise, a linear regression model was implemented to predict continuous outcomes based on input features. The model uses the gradient descent algorithm to minimize the error between the predicted and actual values.

**File**: `linear_regression.ipynb`  
**Explanation**: The notebook covers linear models, loss function, gradient descent optimization, and hyperparameter tuning.

### 2. **Classification**

In this exercise, a logistic regression model was created to predict the probability of binary outcomes. This exercise included evaluating model performance using various metrics like confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC.

**File**: `classification.ipynb`  
**Explanation**: The notebook demonstrates the use of logistic regression and metrics for classification problems, along with model evaluation techniques.

### 3. **Working with Numerical Data**

This exercise focuses on handling and transforming **numerical data**. Key techniques covered include identifying and handling missing or invalid data, scaling, and normalizing numerical features to improve model performance.

**File**: `Numerical data (Programming Statistics and bad values).ipynb`  
**Explanation**: The notebook includes data preprocessing techniques such as imputation and feature scaling, preparing data for training machine learning models.

### 4. **Fairness in Machine Learning**

In this exercise, the focus was on addressing **bias** and **fairness** in machine learning models. It covered techniques for detecting bias in datasets and implementing strategies to mitigate fairness issues.

**File**: `Fairness.ipynb`  
**Explanation**: The notebook explores fairness auditing, identifying biases in models, and implementing methods to reduce the impact of biases on predictions.
